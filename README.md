**Thank you for 300 GitHub stars, and counting!**

Lucia is a library that makes user and session management simple and
clean. It's bare bones by design, making it easy to use and
understand, while providing the flexibility that many other
authentication libraries lack. It's the authentication solution that
works with you and your app.

One thing important to note that this **isn't** an out-of-the-box authentication library. It does not validate the user's input nor does it not provide UI elements or OAuth authentication (though it can be implemented using Lucia). These are out of the scope of this library and is left up to you.
